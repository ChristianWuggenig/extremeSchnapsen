## Game Description

EXTREME SCHNAPSEN is an extension from the conventional ZWEIERSCHNAPSEN, which is very popular in austrian pubs. To raise the 
fun factor we introduced possibilities for cheating, but you also have the chance to uncover the opponent cheating. Each 
player gets five cards, the goal is to give the opponent as much "Bummerln" as possible. A Bummerl consists of several rounds, 
to win an round and get one, two or three points (depending on the points of my rival), when some player gets seven points the 
game is finished and the other player gets a "Bummerl".  


## Cheating

Cheating is allowed once per round! 
We have different types of cheating:
  #1 you can click the button with the two arrows to select a card, this card is sent to my opponent and you receive a random 
  card from the deck of the second player.
  #2 by covering the light sensor you will be able to see the cards of the opponent player
  But be careful this joker can be dangerous too, if the rival thinks, that you have cheated he can parry this joker, if the 
  presumption is right, the counterpart gets 10 extra points in this round, if he is wrong you will get 10 points
